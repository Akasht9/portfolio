			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>As a passionate and driven Web/Software developer, I am seeking my first opportunity to grow and enhance my skills with a company that values creativity, innovation, and growth. With expertise in HTML, ASP.net, C#, MySQL, SQL, and Azure, I am confident in my ability to tackle complex projects and deliver high-quality results.

I am skilled in using a variety of development tools such as Git, GitHub, and Docker, which allow me to collaborate effectively with teams and streamline development processes. My interests and hobbies include playing cricket, photography, travelling, and reading, which help me stay inspired and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

During my training and projects, I had the opportunity to develop and implement an Airline Reservations System using C#. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in the development lifecycle and hone my problem-solving and team leadership skills. Additionally, I have earned certifications and awards such as Advanced Excel Workshop from JS Academy, Microsoft Certified: Azure AZ-900 Fundamental, Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Fundamental, DevOps Fundamental certificate from Udemy, AWS Services for Solutions Architect Associate 2023 certificate from Udemy, Certificate of completion Cloud Foundation from Great Learning, and Introduction to Cloud Computing Certificate from SkillUP by SipliLearn.

My interpersonal skills include being a team player and leader, quick learner, self-motivated, and problem solver. I believe in working collaboratively with teams to deliver outstanding results, and I am committed to continuous learning and development.

Thank you for taking the time to review my profile. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a company's growth while enhancing my skills, and I look forward to exploring potential opportunities in the future.</section>
